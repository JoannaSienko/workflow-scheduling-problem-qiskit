# workflow-scheduling-problem-qiskit

This repository presents how to implement and run workflow scheduling problem with qiskit framework on simulator and quantum computer delivered by IBM Q.
There are 3 different ways of problem translation presented. Two of them uses DOcplex module to choose strength of constraints, in the third one the weights were set manually. 
The results are presented in files: 
1. `plot-docplex-without-modifications`
2. `plot-hamiltonian-with-modified-docplex`
3. `plot-created-hamiltonian`
